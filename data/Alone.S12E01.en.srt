1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,984
<i>They call this place
the Land of Great Thirst.</i>

2
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,420
<i>The great Karoo desert,
South Africa.</i>

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,657
<i>We are in one of the most
inhospitable places on Earth.</i>

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,224
<i>Ten participants.</i>

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,993
<i>Whoever can stay
the longest wins.</i>

6
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,394
<i>It's pretty simple.</i>

7
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,897
I found the baboons.

8
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,265
There's ten of them, but
I only have five arrows.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,236
This place is dry, dry, dry.

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,005
<i>The sun's beating
down on you every day.</i>

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>I'm so tired,
and I'm so thirsty.</i>

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,275
Oh, man.

13
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,144
I really don't feel
safe drinking this water.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,913
<i>This is a place to be,
if not feared,</i>

15
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,515
<i>treated with a lot of respect.</i>

16
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,419
I changed my mind!

17
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,720
Oh, look at the size
of that thing.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,422
There's a big herd
of wildebeest right there.

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,224
- Rhino tracks.
- Meat.

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,825
Back on the menu, boys.

21
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,228
They call Cape buffalo
the black death for a reason.

22
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,362
They'll just
straight up kill you.

23
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,597
<i>We don't control the game.</i>

24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,998
Here you go.

25
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,166
Flooding.

26
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,768
This is nothing
compared to what's coming.

27
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,403
It hurts so much, man.

28
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,804
It's freaking ice.

29
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,040
<i>So the question is,
how strong of a mind</i>

30
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,508
<i>do you need to have
to win this?</i>

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,709
Whoo!

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,811
What the
did I get myself into?

33
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,681
Long cold night.

34
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,318
<i>The last one to tap walks
out of here with 500 grand.</i>

35
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,987
<i>This is one of
the hardest things</i>

36
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,522
<i>that a person can do
in their life.</i>

37
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,990
Oh, my gosh.

38
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,992
It's another
great day in Africa.

39
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,547
<i>Day one is just beginning.</i>

40
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,417
Can't wait to start
this journey.

41
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,684
<i>This season is the first time</i>

42
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,386
<i>we're going to be
in South Africa.</i>

43
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,821
Whoo!
There they go!

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,224
<i>We're in uncharted territory
for "Alone."</i>

45
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,226
Wow. Spectacular.

46
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,262
<i>This is dramatically different
than any of the other seasons.</i>

47
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,830
<i>It's actually
a whole new game.</i>

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,467
<i>This is an arid
desert environment.</i>

49
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,869
There it goes.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,705
<i>And going from extreme heat</i>

51
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,472
<i>with no moisture in the air</i>

52
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>to getting plunged</i>

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,710
<i>into the darkness
and the cold at night,</i>

54
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,312
<i>mixed in with all
of the dangerous animals</i>

55
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>is going to be brutal.</i>

56
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,316
Holy [bleep].
Sorry, Mom.

57
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,118
<i>If ever there was
a thought in your mind</i>

58
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,520
<i>about whether
this was real or fake,</i>

59
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,021
<i>it feels pretty real now.</i>

60
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,556
<i>Being immersed
in the wild life</i>

61
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,059
<i>is going to be
freakin' insane.</i>

62
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,460
<i>Cape buffalo,
when they come at you,</i>

63
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,561
<i>they want you dead.</i>

64
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,830
There goes my last link
to civilization.

65
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,865
<i>There are venomous snakes.</i>

66
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,434
<i>There are venomous scorpions,</i>

67
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,869
<i>extremely poisonous
plants here.</i>

68
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,906
<i>There are ungulates
with huge horns</i>

69
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,741
<i>defending themselves
that could skewer you</i>

70
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,308
<i>like shish kebab.</i>

71
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,876
<i>There is any number of things</i>

72
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,812
<i>that could take you
out of the game</i>

73
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,447
<i>or out of life in a heartbeat.</i>

74
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,916
We're not
in the Arctic anymore.

75
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,952
<i>We're in a desert,
so water's a big thing.</i>

76
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,387
<i>Dehydration is a killer,</i>

77
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,422
<i>but we got to work
for our water.</i>

78
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,357
<i>You have to collect it
and boil it,</i>

79
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,660
<i>because water illness
is a big concern.</i>

80
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,862
They're leaving me alone!

81
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,631
Yee-ha!

82
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,303
<i>You get ten survival experts
with ten items,</i>

83
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,604
<i>and you go drop them off
in the middle of nowhere</i>

84
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,072
<i>with nobody.</i>

85
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,007
<i>You're going to have animals
trying to eat you</i>

86
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,944
<i>and Mother Nature
trying to kill you.</i>

87
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,746
<i>And between all that,
the last one standing</i>

88
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,912
<i>wins half a million dollars.</i>

89
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,783
What did I just
sign up for, guys?

90
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,884
<i>This competition is crazy.</i>

91
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,953
<i>If you're not set up
to survive</i>

92
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,222
<i>in this kind of environment,
I mean, it can get you quick.</i>

93
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,726
Get out of here.

94
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,697
Whoo!

95
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,601
That's what I'm talking about.

96
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,470
No drop shock, baby.
Let's do this.

97
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,007
Let me show you all what
I'm working with here.

98
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,945
Look at this.

99
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,946
I like this spot.

100
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,948
I like it.

101
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,284
I'm right on the lake, boys.

102
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,854
It's a big lake.

103
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,356
I'll show you
this excited face of mine.

104
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,494
Oh, man, guys.

105
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,229
Holy crap.

106
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,233
I wouldn't call it drop shock,
but, damn,

107
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,869
it sure is different.

108
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,307
First thing, let's calm down.

109
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,843
Just chill right
the [bleep] out, Will.

110
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,479
I know this is cool...

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,282
but you got to make
a plan of attack.

112
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,783
You got to see

113
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,885
what the hell you're going
to be doing out here first.

114
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,620
I got to get some
of this water.

115
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,522
But I tell you right now,
from looking at it, it's muddy.

116
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,158
It reminds me of back home,
Lake Casa Blanca--

117
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,161
brown-green water.

118
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,263
Hey, hey, hey.

119
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,265
Keep on going.
Keep going.

120
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,233
Last two!

121
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>I'm an exotic trapper.</i>

122
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,105
<i>I catch, transport,
and house exotic animals.</i>

123
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,875
<i>I work with species
from Africa, Asia, Australia.</i>

124
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,311
<i>If you can imagine,
like, a cattle rancher,</i>

125
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,547
<i>it's basically what we do
but with exotics.</i>

126
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,516
<i>They sell hunts
and stuff like that</i>

127
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,184
<i>on the species
that aren't endangered.</i>

128
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,620
<i>Even though it's powered
by the hunting industry,</i>

129
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,257
<i>it's really having
a big effect on conservation.</i>

130
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,059
<i>A lot of the animals
that we raise</i>

131
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>have gone extinct
in their country of origin.</i>

132
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,962
<i>So now countries
are looking to Texas</i>

133
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,663
<i>to repopulate their supplies.</i>

134
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,238
<i>I would classify myself
as a primitive enthusiast.</i>

135
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,673
<i>I definitely don't do this
for a living,</i>

136
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>but I have what it takes to
take one of these big animals.</i>

137
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,078
<i>I have enough knowledge
of hunting.</i>

138
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,813
<i>I know how to stalk.
I know how to ambush.</i>

139
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,348
<i>I know how to make a blind.</i>

140
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,351
<i>I feel like my skills
are suited for this location</i>

141
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,620
<i>more than any other.</i>

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,256
<i>I'm a very, very
physically capable guy.</i>

143
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,557
<i>I'm a very mentally strong
guy, you know?</i>

144
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>I was made for this, bro.</i>

145
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,862
<i>Now we wait.</i>

146
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,464
Are you going to miss Dada?

147
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,267
<i>My wife and my boy,
they're my sole reason</i>

148
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,836
<i>for being on this Earth now,
you know?</i>

149
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,805
He's loving that, dude.

150
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,808
<i>My main goal is providing
for my family</i>

151
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,811
<i>and creating a legacy
that my boy can be proud of.</i>

152
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,079
<i>He's just a baby right now,</i>

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,748
<i>but when he starts
being a little kid</i>

154
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,516
<i>and, you know,
starts becoming a man</i>

155
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,818
<i>and understanding the world</i>

156
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,552
<i>with the foundation
that I hope to give him,</i>

157
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,589
<i>you know, I hope he sees
this sense of legacy.</i>

158
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,259
- Get it. Get it. Get it.
- Get it, Dada.

159
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,028
<i>If I was ever going
to get a chance</i>

160
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,963
<i>to prove to the world
who William Lamb is,</i>

161
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,666
<i>what I can do,
this is it, man.</i>

162
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,467
<i>This is now or never.</i>

163
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,239
This water is gross.

164
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,275
You will get sick if you drink
this without disinfecting it.

165
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,545
So I'm gonna start
processing some water.

166
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,484
So get my pot.

167
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,020
Just going to cover it...

168
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,022
with the bandanna...

169
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,162
And dip it in.

170
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,601
And that should strain out
all that big stuff.

171
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,706
<i>Whenever you get water
to process, to boil,</i>

172
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,841
<i>you want to cut down on
anything going into the water.</i>

173
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,711
<i>You want to kind of do
your best at filtering it.</i>

174
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,713
Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,548
Look at that.

176
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>I got to get a fire going,
get this water on there.</i>

177
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,260
<i>In this area,
the water is horrible.</i>

178
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,663
<i>You got to understand
that all these animals</i>

179
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,099
<i>are coming to drink here,</i>

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,966
<i>physically getting
in the water.</i>

181
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,768
<i>All of them are crapping
in the water.</i>

182
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,603
<i>And not only that,
I'm on a continent</i>

183
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,706
<i>to where my body is not used
to any of the amoebas,</i>

184
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,074
<i>any of the bacteria.</i>

185
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,110
<i>So I definitely
don't want to drink</i>

186
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>any of this water unprocessed.</i>

187
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:37,383
Get a little tripod action.

188
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,318
Nothing fancy.

189
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,157
Man, this water is rank.

190
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,796
You can smell it.

191
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,901
<i>Not only are we in an area
where its elevated heat,</i>

192
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,668
<i>super, super windy,</i>

193
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,470
<i>so it's just drying you out
like a piece of jerky</i>

194
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,039
<i>the entire time you're there.</i>

195
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,543
<i>Along with all the physical
exertion, you're sweating.</i>

196
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,277
<i>You're using all these fluids.</i>

197
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,381
<i>You have to replace
them pretty regularly.</i>

198
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,884
<i>I'm going to have to have
water going 24-7, you know,</i>

199
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,119
<i>always having
a pot of water cool</i>

200
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,122
<i>or in the process
of purifying water.</i>

201
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,959
<i>Staying hydrated is going
to be a full-time job.</i>

202
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,262
All right.

203
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,432
Let's let this boil.

204
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,169
I'm going to go set up a fish--
a hook and line.

205
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,838
After this boils,
I'll let it cool.

206
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,010
But maybe I can go get
a fish in the meantime.

207
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,697
They're gone.
That's it. It's just me.

208
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,233
Look, just me.

209
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,035
Okay.

210
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,803
I have water here.
That's good.

211
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,672
I'm just going to--
I'm going to camp here tonight,

212
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,040
for sure, on this little beach.

213
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,908
I like being this close
to water.

214
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,643
I'm going to explore up here
a little bit.

215
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,012
That's my plan.

216
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,714
Get water going.

217
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,082
And then tonight
with my headlamp,

218
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,383
I can do little things.

219
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,552
Okay, calm down.

220
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,990
We'll go
for a little walkabout.

221
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>Here in South Africa,
the land is characterized</i>

222
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,364
<i>by open grasslands and plains</i>

223
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>and rocky hills
with cliffs and boulders.</i>

224
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,803
So many rocks.
You got to be careful.

225
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,306
<i>My strategy is to find
where everything is.</i>

226
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,008
<i>I'm not sure what the
resources</i>

227
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,309
<i>are going to be here.</i>

228
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,011
<i>I need to explore
all my territory.</i>

229
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,313
I can't believe I'm on "Alone."

230
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,983
If I don't catch fish

231
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,584
or shoot something,
I don't eat.

232
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,486
Like, that's very real.

233
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,623
<i>My hope is to find where
the animals are living,</i>

234
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,558
<i>where they're coming in
to find water,</i>

235
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,861
<i>because hunting
is my priority.</i>

236
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,830
But right now, day one,

237
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,267
just need to look around
and take it all in.

238
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,307
Look at these.

239
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,110
I don't know. I think
those are baboon tracks.

240
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,346
We're going to have problems

241
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,348
because they're
like little people

242
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,150
that are going to, like,
attack you,

243
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,486
rip you up, steal your stuff.

244
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,427
Hmm.
That's interesting.

245
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,832
Karen--Karen, touch it.

246
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,768
It's pretty dry.

247
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,205
By the way, I named
my camera Karen.

248
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,842
So we'll see how we
get along out here.

249
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,046
Okay.

250
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,347
Never truly been alone.

251
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,549
I've either had
family, friends.

252
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,019
I mean,
there's always somebody.

253
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,753
Nice rainy day.

254
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,623
<i>I've been with my boyfriend,
Brady, for seven years.</i>

255
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,726
<i>We live completely off-grid
in Montana.</i>

256
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,062
We have the big totes that
we catch the rainwater with,

257
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,630
so this is how
we do our dishes.

258
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,865
<i>You have to be tough.</i>

259
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,169
<i>You don't get all the comforts
of a regular household.</i>

260
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>Having an outhouse
for a bathroom,</i>

261
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,074
<i>and having to cross a river
to get to the house,</i>

262
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,042
<i>it makes you strong
physically.</i>

263
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,112
Today we're going to make
a natural water-filter system.

264
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,983
Charcoal.

265
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,218
And I'm just going to
throw it in on top.

266
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,820
From the river.

267
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,355
<i>The practical skills
I'm most confident in</i>

268
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,156
<i>would be hunting...</i>

269
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,660
All right.
We can eat beaver tonight.

270
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,827
<i>Fishing...</i>

271
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,662
Oh, yeah.

272
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,664
<i>Fire building, because I've
been doing it my whole life.</i>

273
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,832
Aha.

274
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,167
<i>The $500,000
is important to me</i>

275
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,603
<i>because I run
Long Acres Rescue,</i>

276
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,007
<i>and we help wild burros
and mustangs find new homes.</i>

277
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,308
That's Whiskey.

278
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,477
<i>That money would help me
rescue more animals.</i>

279
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,546
<i>But I want to do "Alone" to
show that women are stronger</i>

280
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,914
<i>than they think they are.</i>

281
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,583
<i>I'm going to be that girl
that they were like,</i>

282
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,318
<i>I should have paid
more attention</i>

283
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,620
<i>to what she was doing,</i>

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,522
<i>because I'm a force
to be reckoned with.</i>

285
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,561
So many noises.

286
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,670
Was that a baboon?

287
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,973
Um...

288
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,109
I'm just trying to
see if I can see it,

289
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,644
figure out what it is.

290
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,385
Freaking baboons
over on that ridge.

291
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,522
They're yelling at me.

292
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,225
So we're going to stay clear.

293
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,494
Don't go there.

294
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,033
Oh, my gosh, those baboons
don't like me being here.

295
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,002
<i>They gave us horror stories
of the baboons.</i>

296
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,603
<i>They play dead.</i>

297
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,306
<i>You shoot them, you go up to
them, and they're not dead,</i>

298
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,307
<i>and the rest of them
turning on you.</i>

299
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,309
They're just yelling.

300
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,311
<i>I don't want them
anywhere near me.</i>

301
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,447
There's more poop.

302
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,784
Those baboons are yelling.

303
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,655
We can share, guys.

304
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,256
We can share.

305
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,060
You get that side,
I get this side, capisce?

306
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,668
These freaking baboons
are following me.

307
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,070
I don't like it.

308
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,506
I think there's ten of them.

309
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,607
I only have five arrows
right now.

310
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,445
<i>Baboons can be
in troops of 60 to 100.</i>

311
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,247
<i>They have giant fangs.</i>

312
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,117
<i>They can steal your stuff,
get into camp.</i>

313
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,286
<i>And I want them to know that
this is my area now,</i>

314
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,554
<i>not theirs.</i>

315
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,425
I'm going to let them know
that I'm here now.

316
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,395
This is my spot!

317
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,864
Get! Get!

318
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,869
Okay.

319
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,872
They seem to be going up, so
hopefully they stay going up.

320
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,708
But they're not happy.

321
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:13,245
Okay, we got to head back,
get camp set up for the night.

322
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,351
<i>I'm not worried about any
other animals, just baboons.</i>

323
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,821
<i>I actually love trying
to get close to animals,</i>

324
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,355
<i>seeing how close I can get.</i>

325
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,757
<i>I've been charged
three times by grizzlies.</i>

326
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,959
<i>I am not afraid
of a Cape buffalo</i>

327
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,594
<i>or a rhino coming in.</i>

328
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,665
I'm pretty much back to
where they dropped me off.

329
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,468
The good news, guys--

330
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,903
got to look
on the bright side--

331
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,603
I still see my stuff.

332
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,174
So baboons have not came
and taken it.

333
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,010
So that's good news.

334
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,447
I think I'm going to set
everything up over here.

335
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,784
And if I have a pokey tree...

336
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,287
baboons shouldn't come
from above, right?

337
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,923
So I think I'm just going to
kind of put all my stuff here.

338
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,259
Okay.

339
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,711
All right, I'm going to show
the whole lake right now.

340
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,913
It's amazing, it's beautiful,
and it's so quiet.

341
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,382
After the helicopter leaves,
forget about it.

342
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,785
Oh, my God.

343
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,587
I think I'm gonna
like this area.

344
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,223
Check it out, guys.

345
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,426
Awesome.
Oh, my God.

346
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,862
All alone.

347
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,197
I put the GoPro
on the walking stick.

348
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,235
That way's easier for me
to explore a little bit.

349
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:46,404
Ooh, a lot of loose rocks here.

350
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,474
I got to be
really careful here.

351
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,944
Very easy to--
Look at that.

352
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,552
Very old, but that means
they come around here.

353
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,154
It's getting very hot...

354
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,191
so I can't be spending
too much time walking around.

355
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,461
And I'm from Cuba...

356
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,396
Where it's humid, hot.

357
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,966
Now for some 3D archery.

358
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,302
<i>My name is Pablo Arguelles.</i>

359
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,270
<i>I'm originally from Cuba,</i>

360
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,706
<i>and now I live
in Jacksonville, Florida.</i>

361
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,008
Alligators, that's one
thing here in Florida

362
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,676
<i>we got a lot of.</i>

363
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,245
<i>I lived in Cuba
until I was 11 years old.</i>

364
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,547
<i>My dad wasn't a part
of the Communist Party.</i>

365
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,384
<i>They didn't believe
in the Communist dictatorship</i>

366
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,985
<i>and the way of thinking.</i>

367
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,255
<i>We lived
in a tough environment</i>

368
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,822
<i>and poor conditions.</i>

369
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,759
<i>I know how to build
different kinds of shelters.</i>

370
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,861
<i>I know how to fish.</i>

371
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,662
Ugh! Actually,
it feels good on my back.

372
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,797
<i>I can hunt.
I can trap.</i>

373
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,832
<i>I love things outside,
because it felt free.</i>

374
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,467
<i>Like, forget
about the government.</i>

375
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,403
<i>Say whatever you want here.
There's nobody around.</i>

376
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,470
Boom, baby!

377
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,472
<i>So we left in 1980--</i>

378
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,907
<i>me, my parents, and my sister.</i>

379
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,909
<i>My brothers
had to stay behind.</i>

380
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,444
<i>And to this day,</i>

381
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,982
<i>I view survival as doing
whatever it takes to make it.</i>

382
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,083
That was not easy,
doing it by yourself,

383
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,785
but that's the way
you got to do it.

384
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,655
You got to use your teeth,
whatever tools you got.

385
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,957
<i>I'm doing "Alone,"
because to me,</i>

386
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,625
<i>it's going to be
the most incredible experience</i>

387
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,226
<i>of my life.</i>

388
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,663
<i>I quit my job to go on this
thing full-force, nonstop.</i>

389
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,633
<i>I didn't want nothing
to be on my way.</i>

390
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,769
<i>I feel very confident
that I can do anything.</i>

391
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,571
<i>I'm going to be
the first Cuban on "Alone."</i>

392
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,342
<i>And this, to me,
is honoring my parents</i>

393
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,545
<i>because they fought so hard
for us to have a better life.</i>

394
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,245
<i>Qué bueno.</i>
Yeah.

395
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,983
<i>And for them
to see me winning this...</i>

396
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,116
Whoo!

397
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,718
<i>It would be incredible.</i>

398
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,587
<i>$500,000, for sure,
will be a life-changing event</i>

399
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,022
<i>for me and my fiancée,</i>

400
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,224
<i>and I can help my parents
as much as possible,</i>

401
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,392
<i>whatever they need.</i>

402
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,794
<i>To me, this is
the American Dream.</i>

403
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,533
Check this water out.

404
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,769
It looks pretty nasty.

405
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,270
I got to boil it really good

406
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,439
and eventually make
a water filter.

407
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,075
<i>Here, drinking water
is going to be a major thing</i>

408
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,645
<i>because I can overheat
and get hyperthermia.</i>

409
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>But what if I get something
from this water</i>

410
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,749
<i>and then I go home sick,</i>

411
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,151
<i>or who knows
what's going to happen?</i>

412
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,787
So I'm going to do
a coyote well.

413
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,624
All right, I'm going to try
to make a coyote well

414
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,861
and see if this works.

415
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,462
Hopefully it does...

416
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,998
and we can get
a little bit cleaner water.

417
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,105
<i>A coyote well--basically,
you dig a hole away</i>

418
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,006
<i>from the edge of the water,</i>

419
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,808
<i>and then the earth itself</i>

420
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,911
<i>is going to start filtering
the water.</i>

421
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,846
Oh, yeah.

422
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,716
It's getting nice
and soft in there.

423
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,218
<i>It's going to fill
that well up.</i>

424
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,585
<i>It's going to be
dirty at first,</i>

425
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,120
<i>so you got to empty it</i>

426
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,823
<i>until the water starts
getting cleaner and cleaner.</i>

427
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,526
There you go.
It's getting muddy now.

428
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,495
There we go.
I see water.

429
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,629
Awesome.

430
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,264
<i>Then you can boil the water,</i>

431
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,066
<i>and it'll be a lot safer
to drink.</i>

432
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,069
<i>Every problem, to me,
has a solution.</i>

433
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,470
<i>You just got to take your time</i>

434
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,639
<i>and find the solution
to the problem.</i>

435
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,041
<i>And I think I developed that
from my dad.</i>

436
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,944
<i>Use what you got,</i>

437
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,146
<i>because in Cuba,
you don't have nothing.</i>

438
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,748
<i>You got to make things work
for real.</i>

439
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,883
<i>And that's
the kind of person I am.</i>

440
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,920
All right.

441
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,721
Now we just have to wait

442
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,391
till it fills up...

443
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,861
And hopefully works.

444
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,679
I think...

445
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,514
I think I've got
a beautiful spot.

446
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,584
This is [bleep] stunning.

447
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,520
So I've got access to this
valley and this little gully,

448
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,555
it looks like.

449
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,060
And this proximity to water
is pretty spectacular.

450
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,427
<i>We're going to
need a lot of water</i>

451
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,862
<i>to keep ourselves
going out here.</i>

452
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,797
<i>And that's why I chose
to bring a water bottle,</i>

453
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,566
<i>so that I could keep
clean water with me,</i>

454
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,969
<i>sipping throughout the day.</i>

455
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,670
Oh, got some prickly pear.

456
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,074
Well, that'll be a good snack
at some point.

457
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,078
Whoa.

458
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,514
Oh, my God.
I thought that was a rock.

459
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,949
That's not a rock.
That's a baboon.

460
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,219
Holy [bleep], that's huge.

461
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,022
Why don't you guys
stay up there,

462
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,225
and I'll stay down
here for a while?

463
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,761
They seem pretty content
up there...

464
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,764
for now.

465
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,270
Let's head back and go fishing.

466
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,544
I know they can see me.
There's no way they can't.

467
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,212
<i>I probably spent a couple
of hundred nights out</i>

468
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,247
<i>in some different locations
and different environments,</i>

469
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,783
<i>but here it just feels
that little bit harder.</i>

470
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,552
Fire time!

471
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,820
Satisfying noise.

472
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,222
Ah, crackle!

473
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,658
<i>The real connection
to the outdoors</i>

474
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,225
<i>started when I was a teenager.</i>

475
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,359
Yeah, boy!

476
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,761
<i>The army cadets
at school gave me</i>

477
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,697
<i>this opportunity
to go out in the elements,</i>

478
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,299
<i>and that was fantastic.</i>

479
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,201
Preparation, patience
and practice.

480
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,468
<i>I grew up in South London.</i>

481
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,370
<i>Just before university,
I ended up going</i>

482
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,472
<i>over to Asia and India
and traveling quite a lot.</i>

483
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,441
<i>And that sort of opened
my eyes up to the world.</i>

484
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,544
<i>And that's how I sort of
ended up in New Zealand.</i>

485
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,313
<i>This is Anakiwa
in the Marlborough Sounds.</i>

486
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,949
<i>I have been
an outdoor educator</i>

487
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,383
<i>for about nine years, worked
as an operations manager</i>

488
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,919
<i>for an outdoor-education
charity for the last two.</i>

489
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,588
<i>Whilst it's also
about learning the hard skills</i>

490
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,156
<i>of living outside...</i>

491
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,659
You can already see when pull
it apart how fibrous it is.

492
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,061
See that?

493
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,229
<i>Some of the most rewarding
parts of the work</i>

494
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,865
<i>has been when that light bulb
goes off in a student's mind</i>

495
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,600
<i>and they do something
that they didn't think</i>

496
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,834
<i>they were capable of.</i>

497
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,070
There you have it.
This trap will catch things.

498
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:55,039
I could use this as bait
for other fish.

499
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,008
<i>The reason I think I can take
this challenge on</i>

500
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,644
<i>is because, ultimately,
when you get out there,</i>

501
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,212
<i>it's the challenge
against yourself.</i>

502
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,714
<i>I do like pushing myself.</i>

503
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,983
<i>And so, for me,
this is that opportunity</i>

504
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,752
<i>to do that before I devote
myself again to service.</i>

505
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,422
<i>I'm going to miss creature
comforts, for sure,</i>

506
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,424
<i>but I'm also going to miss
my partner, Maddie.</i>

507
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,393
<i>She has been so supportive.</i>

508
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,296
<i>She said she doesn't mind
how long I'm out here,</i>

509
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,264
<i>but she does want me
to come home in one piece.</i>

510
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,266
<i>$500,000 is a lot of money.</i>

511
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,600
<i>You know,
we could potentially buy</i>

512
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,369
<i>a little plot of land
somewhere.</i>

513
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,372
<i>But for me, "Alone"
is that real opportunity</i>

514
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,309
<i>to learn the things that
I haven't learnt about me.</i>

515
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,746
Beautiful place.

516
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,920
There's already stuff
splashing around down here.

517
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>I'm going to be hoping
to focus on getting fish</i>

518
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,993
<i>and whatever plants I can find
in the area, to start with.</i>

519
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,062
<i>If I can sustain myself
on that,</i>

520
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,299
<i>then I'll be able
to go hunting.</i>

521
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,166
Got a little praying mantis.

522
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,268
That is going to be bait.

523
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,405
<i>My fishing is generally</i>

524
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,675
<i>with a beer in one hand
and as many hooks as you want.</i>

525
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,243
Oh, it's dirty.

526
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,812
I'm wondering if that
water's any good.

527
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,714
It will boil off.

528
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,786
Let me get you, little fishy.

529
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:18,222
<i>The water is filled with stuff
that's of danger to us.</i>

530
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,558
<i>Obviously, I'm going
to be boiling my water.</i>

531
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,395
<i>But with that, being conscious
of things like fish,</i>

532
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,564
<i>if I catch one</i>

533
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:30,034
<i>and then touch my bottle
with dirty water,</i>

534
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,036
<i>I then need to boil my bottle.</i>

535
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,073
<i>I'm going to be thinking
about clean water constantly.</i>

536
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:40,279
.
This isn't going well.

537
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,058
You just don't even
know how deep it is.

538
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,145
<i>Probably wasted
an hour around here.</i>

539
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,614
<i>Let's go.</i>

540
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,950
<i>I feel like my body is saying,
hey, it's time to take a poo,</i>

541
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,918
<i>but I haven't eaten anything.</i>

542
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,187
<i>So the plan is getting
some water on.</i>

543
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,555
<i>And while the water
is boiling,</i>

544
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,557
<i>get my first go
with the prickly pears.</i>

545
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,995
<i>I feel I've been fortunate
enough to work</i>

546
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,698
<i>in a lot of different places
around the world,</i>

547
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:33,899
<i>a lot of different climates,</i>

548
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,533
<i>a lot of different
environments,</i>

549
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,202
<i>and I've learnt how to adapt
to different places.</i>

550
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,373
It's hard to tell if I've
gotten all the hairs off.

551
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,911
There's still other little
soft ones floating around.

552
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,680
And those look like the ones
that might not cause

553
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,819
a problem on the way in
but potentially on the way out.

554
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,486
<i>"Alone" is one hell
of a competition.</i>

555
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,723
<i>It's not just about surviving
with limited items.</i>

556
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,992
<i>It's also about learning
that environment.</i>

557
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,195
Okay, that's it. I've got to be
a lot more vigorous.

558
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,497
<i>Quite a big part
of Outward Bound</i>

559
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,198
<i>is not knowing your schedule</i>

560
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,833
<i>and not knowing
what's coming next</i>

561
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,002
<i>and just learning to roll
with the punches.</i>

562
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,508
They don't actually
taste too bad.

563
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,276
So it's gonna be
a great opportunity

564
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
to practice all those
mindfulness skills

565
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,281
that I've been
educating others on.

566
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,583
It's amazing how
just a little something

567
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,620
can just give me
a little bit of a boost.

568
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,921
All right.

569
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,423
Let's work out
what I need to lie down in.

570
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,547
Well, this gonna be
my temporary shelter

571
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,115
for the night.

572
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,417
It's like a little lean-to.

573
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,620
Part of the tarp,
I used as a floor.

574
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,389
That way I'm not
completely on the ground,

575
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,758
knowing there's scorpions here.

576
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,364
I will completely agree
it is not great.

577
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,832
Small shelter,

578
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,401
but it will hopefully
keep me warm.

579
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,605
Just need to know
that I can get food

580
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,207
before I start wasting energy

581
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,344
making this place all luxurious

582
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,713
and digging it down
and all that sort of stuff.

583
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,715
Before I waste
too much energy doing that,

584
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,284
I need to know
that I can get energy.

585
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,121
So I'm gonna sit here
and drink my water.

586
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,728
I can't help wondering what's
going on with everybody else

587
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,396
and how they're doing.

588
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,868
Mm.

589
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,402
I keep getting
flashes of, like,

590
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:56,007
Will and Colton
and Kelsey and Jit.

591
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,843
Oh, my God, Dug and Doug.

592
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,113
Oh, God.

593
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:05,316
Pablo--ooh, yes.

594
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,220
I just saw a fish jump.

595
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,187
<i>Before it gets dark,
I'm going to throw a line in</i>

596
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,823
<i>and see what's possible
and then start to think about,</i>

597
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:16,360
<i>where am I
going to sleep tonight?</i>

598
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,562
Yeah.

599
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,231
Well, it'd be nice
to catch a fish.

600
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,368
The moon's coming up.

601
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,972
Karen, look at the moon.

602
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:31,242
Okay, I got to flip you around
so you can see this moon.

603
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,677
It's wild, what I'm doing,

604
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:36,047
just living under the stars
in South Africa.

605
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,150
I'm definitely gonna sleep
under the stars

606
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,385
for the first few nights.

607
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,188
And there's the moon.

608
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,357
<i>I grew up
in Northern Wisconsin,</i>

609
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,527
<i>so I'm not worried
about being cold.</i>

610
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,297
<i>I just want to be simple
and focus on hunting.</i>

611
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,564
Super cool.

612
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,566
Just got to make it
till daylight.

613
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,384
You hear that?

614
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,820
Damn, man.

615
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,727
But I guess I'm gonna
have to get used to that.

616
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,565
Smoked prickly pear.

617
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,633
I'm excited.

618
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,069
You hear that?

619
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,207
Freaking baboons.

620
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,045
The baboons are pretty loud.

621
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:47,351
I heard one on my side
of the river, screaming.

622
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,822
Hopefully, they just
stay away tonight.

623
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,262
I just woke up,
stoked the fire a little bit.

624
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,499
I ended up moving the fire
closer to me this way.

625
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,433
Help keep me warm tonight.

626
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,638
Whew! Okay.

627
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,309
So this is Katie, "Alone,"
season 12, night one.

628
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,547
And look what I just
managed to bring in--

629
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,783
an Orange River mudfish.

630
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,517
I'm just going to take it
over to the fire

631
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,952
and cook it for dinner.

632
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,424
Anyway, first night in,
I've got a fish.

633
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,476
Here we go.

634
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,046
Mmm.

635
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,517
It's just like back home.

636
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,685
It's crazy.

637
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,689
What is it with
plants and prickles?

638
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,261
Just harvesting breakfast--

639
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,665
fish soup with acacia seeds

640
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:11,435
and buffalo leaves.

641
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,637
I feel really confident
that I'm gonna be able

642
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,073
to keep bringing fish in.

643
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,676
But I've been thinking
a lot about plant food

644
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,112
as a supplement
to make sure that

645
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,914
I've got a lot of those
alternatives dialed in,

646
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,685
so that even if I don't have
protein on one day,

647
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:32,257
I've still got other food
to eat that's psychologically

648
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,992
keeping me in the game.

649
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,762
Indigenous people
back home in Australia

650
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:41,500
used to eat these seeds,
the acacia seeds.

651
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,201
It's something that made them
extremely strong.

652
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,072
Hey, this is
the beautiful coastline

653
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,840
where I live.

654
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,209
<i>I'm Katie Ridge, and I live</i>

655
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,645
<i>on the East Coast
of Australia.</i>

656
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,848
<i>I'm a mom, and I live
with my two kids.</i>

657
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:02,987
<i>And my world really revolves
around what I do.</i>

658
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,823
<i>I run a school</i>

659
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,459
<i>called Nature Philosophy,</i>

660
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>which teaches survival skills,
nature connection,</i>

661
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,396
<i>and sacred ceremony.</i>

662
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,433
<i>And it's been something
I've been doing for 20 years.</i>

663
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,135
See that?

664
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,437
That's food.

665
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,708
<i>I'd like to think of myself
as a jack of many trades</i>

666
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,876
<i>and master of some.</i>

667
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,280
<i>I'm not just a bow hunter
or I'm not just a fisher.</i>

668
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,149
<i>I can do lots
of different skills.</i>

669
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,486
So these are all
some of my baskets.

670
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,458
<i>Traps, shelter,
construction, fire.</i>

671
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,660
<i>I feel really confident
fishing.</i>

672
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,395
<i>I've done a lot of harvesting
of bush foods</i>

673
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,465
<i>for big groups of people,
long 10-day processes</i>

674
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,670
<i>of how to ferment toxic foods
into edible breads.</i>

675
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,039
<i>And I know that that'll
actually give me an edge.</i>

676
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,074
It's beautiful.

677
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,110
<i>I feel like I'm unique
for season 12</i>

678
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,713
<i>because I'm an Aussie,
so I've had a lot</i>

679
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,682
<i>of experience
in arid environments.</i>

680
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:05,883
You.

681
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:06,951
<i>I'm here to win</i>

682
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,186
<i>and support my kids.</i>

683
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,988
<i>I could buy us
a house to live in.</i>

684
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,258
<i>I've been having to rent,
so this would be</i>

685
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,826
<i>a huge thing
for me and my kids.</i>

686
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,597
<i>I'm following what feels right
in my heart,</i>

687
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,632
<i>and I'm not
fully understanding</i>

688
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,133
<i>where it's taking me.</i>

689
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,437
<i>But I know that this is
exactly where I'm meant to be.</i>

690
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,506
Bye!

691
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,506
See you guys.

692
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,374
all: Bye!

693
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,912
I can smell an animal.

694
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,825
Ooh, yeah, that's strong.

695
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,462
They ran up the hill.

696
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,999
But if I push on it now,

697
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,236
it'll avoid this whole area.

698
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,837
This is a whole massive channel

699
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,408
that runs all the way
down here to the water.

700
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,109
This is the superhighway.

701
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,445
Check it out.

702
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:49,587
This is the sort of
country that just hides

703
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,089
everything from you at first.

704
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,358
And then you start to realize

705
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,728
there's food
all over the place.

706
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,111
All right, guys.

707
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:19,116
See those little things
sticking up on the rocks?

708
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,020
Those are baboons.

709
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,764
Some "Jungle Book" for you.

710
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,833
I'm probably in their spot.

711
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,201
This is probably where
they come down

712
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,670
to the water to drink.

713
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,871
All right.

714
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,773
I'm gonna take my bow,
go up there,

715
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,975
and just see
if it pushes them off,

716
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,611
see if they get aggressive.

717
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,647
Once I go up there,
I imagine I'll push them off.

718
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,814
But if they come back down

719
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,783
and try to come mess
with my [bleep],

720
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,084
I'm going to have to come
back down.

721
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,222
All right.

722
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,889
Let's see what happens,

723
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,259
and then I'll scout
some hunting spots.

724
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,198
<i>My job in the exotic
animal industry,</i>

725
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,234
<i>it's incredibly fun,
rewarding.</i>

726
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,971
<i>You get to work with species
no one ever gets to see.</i>

727
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,107
<i>You're hands-on,
literally, with them.</i>

728
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,244
It's good to know that
even with me making noise...

729
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,015
<i>But baboons are
one of the animals</i>

730
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,485
<i>that I have never had
any interaction with.</i>

731
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,987
<i>Not only are they
pretty vicious,</i>

732
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,823
<i>but they can be
a pain in the ass.</i>

733
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,959
<i>They can come into your camp,
just ransack your stuff.</i>

734
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,828
<i>And when you're trying
to survive on ten items,</i>

735
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,030
<i>any one of those items
gets messed up,</i>

736
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,534
<i>that can mean the game
for you right there.</i>

737
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,635
All right.

738
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,405
I made it
to the top of the hill.

739
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,745
I hear those damn
baboons again.

740
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,115
I don't want to go too far
from my camp.

741
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:02,319
There's a ton of animals
out here.

742
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:09,461
Over on my left,
I see two big black outlines.

743
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,429
I hope they're not
Cape buffalo.

744
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,835
But on the right,
I see a big herd of kudu.

745
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,169
They got big horns.

746
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,040
Whoa.

747
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,736
.

748
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,607
Oh, well.

749
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,475
It'd be a bad idea

750
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,045
to take an animal that big
right now, though.

751
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,717
It's just too much animal.

752
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,419
Not ready.

753
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,464
All right.

754
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,367
Let's see what else
we can find.

755
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,324
Oh, look at this.

756
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,595
My coyote well is right there.

757
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,271
Water is so dirty.

758
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,440
Wow.

759
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,110
Let me take you deep inside.

760
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,115
I don't know how contaminated
this water is.

761
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,751
I know I got to stay
hydrated, for sure,

762
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,922
but I don't want to get sick
from it or something worse.

763
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:23,126
So I need to make sure
from now on I filter somehow.

764
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,628
Because, otherwise,
you're going to have

765
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,831
problems later on.

766
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,967
Got to try something else.

767
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,673
All right.

768
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,177
I'm gonna use my bandana
to put on top of this

769
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:43,847
so it helps filter it
a little bit more.

770
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,350
I think a single layer
should be fine,

771
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,986
and then boil it really good.

772
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,422
<i>Something so simple here
as just getting water</i>

773
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,790
<i>becomes a big challenge.</i>

774
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,993
<i>It's going to be
a lot of work.</i>

775
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,429
<i>But I think I ended up
the way I am now,</i>

776
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,398
<i>going through
experience good and bad,</i>

777
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,002
and the many challenges
that have come in my life.

778
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,904
It's time to start
making a fire.

779
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:10,240
<i>But then you overcome that
and go, this got me here.</i>

780
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,678
There she goes.

781
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,213
<i>I believe when
you try really hard</i>

782
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:19,750
<i>and you really want something,
you got to go 100%.</i>

783
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,184
All right.

784
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,021
<i>Whatever happens after that
is out of my hands,</i>

785
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,788
<i>but at least I went for it.</i>

786
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,326
<i>That's why I quit my job
to focus on this thing 100%,</i>

787
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,361
<i>because I didn't want
any distraction.</i>

788
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,997
<i>So I know I can be here
for the long run.</i>

789
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,836
Yeah, it should be good.

790
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,584
Oh, God, it feels good,
even though it's hot.

791
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:58,789
Yes.

792
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,990
It's crazy.

793
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:04,161
Something so simple
becomes a challenge.

794
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,608
I survived the first night.

795
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,146
No baboons came and attacked
me, so that's good.

796
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,286
I do push-ups every morning,

797
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,389
so I'm going to do
my morning push-ups.

798
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,443
Okay, let's go
on a little walk.

799
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,013
<i>You can only shoot animals</i>

800
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,715
<i>with whatever poundage bow
you have,</i>

801
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,518
<i>and you're at a disadvantage
if you shoot a lower poundage.</i>

802
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,221
<i>And so I brought
a 50-pound bow.</i>

803
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,555
<i>I can pull it back,
but it's just a matter</i>

804
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,190
<i>of how often and how much.</i>

805
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,860
<i>But I'm very confident
I can shoot out</i>

806
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,429
<i>to 30 yards and kill something
with my 50-pound bow.</i>

807
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,865
I hear monkeys.

808
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,268
Stupid baboons.

809
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,936
<i>I think this season is
gonna be maybe</i>

810
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,707
<i>a little easier
due to the weather.</i>

811
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,408
<i>We're not dealing
with negative 30s.</i>

812
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,877
<i>We're not dealing
with the snow.</i>

813
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,612
<i>We're gonna see more big game.</i>

814
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,548
<i>But I think people are
underestimating</i>

815
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,483
<i>how hard it's gonna be
to get game.</i>

816
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,954
Let's follow this trail.

817
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,589
<i>I think people are
just gonna think</i>

818
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,824
<i>there's game everywhere.</i>

819
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,426
<i>I can just go out
and shoot something.</i>

820
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,363
Look, we're almost at the top.

821
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:48,665
That's where I want to be.

822
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,874
Okay.

823
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,878
Oh, guys, look.
Look, look, look, look, look.

824
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:06,316
Do you see it?

825
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,219
It's a waterbuck.

826
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,825
Sucks.

827
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:17,828
I can't shoot those.

828
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,529
Those are 60-pound animals,

829
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,666
meaning you need
a 60-pound bow.

830
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,935
So I can't shoot them,

831
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,238
'cause I only have
a 50-pound bow.

832
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,677
All right.
Can't do anything about it.

833
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,644
Move on.

834
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,362
I just heard something bark
ov--

835
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,835
I don't know what that is.

836
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,310
I don't see any animals.

837
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,837
I got to get down low.

838
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,273
I got to get
down low.

839
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:44,915
Oh, my God.

840
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,319
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

841
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,512
Oh, my God, I got a warthog.

842
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:19,350
He's not down yet.
I got to go finish him.

843
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,917
You got him.

844
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,586
My legs are shaking.

845
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,605
Okay, that one was a good shot,
went all the way through.

846
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,108
I saw it come out
the other side.

847
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,510
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:49,312
Oh, my goodness.

849
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,748
Okay, its dead.

850
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,350
It's officially dead.

851
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,754
This is my first
recurve kill ever.

852
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,994
<i>I shoot a compound bow
back home when I go hunting.</i>

853
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:07,998
<i>So coming on the show,
I needed to learn recurve.</i>

854
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,233
This is warthog.

855
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,271
With my bow.

856
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,709
Oh, God.

857
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,011
I'm very proud.

858
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,613
I'm glad I had patience.

859
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
<i>Coming into "Alone,"</i>

860
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,084
<i>over eight weeks
I shot three times a day,</i>

861
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:31,321
<i>every single day,
rain or shine.</i>

862
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:34,958
<i>I would shoot
until I was tired.</i>

863
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:39,429
<i>I'm very proud that
I can pull a 50-pound bow.</i>

864
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,467
Okay, you guys,
now the work begins.

865
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,070
I got to get going,
'cause it's gonna get hot.

866
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,909
I'm not too far from camp,
maybe half a mile.

867
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,912
I'm gonna see what I can do
to drag her back whole.

868
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,150
Um...[sighs] Man.

869
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,284
Okay.

870
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,553
<i>I am concerned</i>

871
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,289
<i>about the sun
wrecking the meat.</i>

872
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:15,398
<i>I am concerned about</i>

873
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,435
<i>the flies laying eggs
on the meat.</i>

874
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,272
Oh, my gosh, she's so heavy.

875
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:24,274
<i>The meat's going to spoil
very fast.</i>

876
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:29,112
<i>I need to get the meat
to camp as soon as possible.</i>

877
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,313
Nope. Okay.

878
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,514
Well...

879
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,955
She's not even halfway in.

880
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,394
Seriously?

881
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,834
There's no way
I can get up with her.

882
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:14,991
<i>The warthog has to weigh
at least 100 pounds.</i>

883
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,593
<i>I know a lot of it is bone.</i>

884
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,962
<i>I know a lot of it is guts.</i>

885
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,235
Here's the heart.

886
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:29,773
<i>It is impossible to drag
this heavy of an animal</i>

887
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:32,275
<i>with the rocks here.</i>

888
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,078
<i>I need to quarter the warthog.</i>

889
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,148
<i>That is what just
has to happen for me</i>

890
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,384
<i>to get the warthog
back to camp.</i>

891
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,952
<i>I don't want to waste
any meat.</i>

892
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,424
<i>That's just disrespectful
to the animal.</i>

893
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,627
<i>I'm not worried about
how many calories</i>

894
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,264
<i>I put into preserving it.</i>

895
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,565
<i>It's just respect to me.</i>

896
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:06,176
I got the whole pig back.

897
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,513
Now I have to get
a smoker built.

898
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,885
<i>I'm building
an open tripod smoker</i>

899
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,754
<i>because it is
a quicker process</i>

900
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,722
<i>and I need a smoker
right away.</i>

901
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,158
<i>I found a part of
a blue bush tree.</i>

902
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,462
<i>I'm going to use
blue bush sticks,</i>

903
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,830
<i>tie them together,
and then build a rack</i>

904
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,398
<i>so I can lay my meat out.</i>

905
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,834
<i>I also need to build
a grill so that I can</i>

906
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:33,970
<i>cook some of the meat
so I can eat it tonight.</i>

907
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,872
Flies are getting bad.

908
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:37,807
I've got to get this
on the fire.

909
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,043
<i>The flies came in really fast.</i>

910
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:41,911
<i>They can lay eggs instantly</i>

911
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,713
<i>and the meat is
gonna be ruined.</i>

912
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,250
Heck, yeah, guys, look at this.

913
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,986
Warthog backstrap.

914
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,156
That's dinner tonight.

915
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,227
Gosh golly, so many ants.

916
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:00,230
<i>The ants also found
the warthog meat,</i>

917
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,967
<i>and I keep having
to brush them off.</i>

918
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:06,402
I just got to get this meat
off this bone.

919
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,137
<i>It's a lot of work.</i>

920
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,274
<i>So I'm going to put the meat
in between the two</i>

921
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:14,210
<i>layers of my tarp
laid out flat,</i>

922
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,713
<i>so I'm sleeping next
to my meat to make sure</i>

923
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,249
<i>nothing gets it
and it stays cool.</i>

924
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,351
<i>Out here, a predator
is not going to come in</i>

925
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,152
<i>when I'm right there.</i>

926
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,721
<i>They're going to smell
the human.</i>

927
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:26,289
<i>They're going to run away.</i>

928
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,826
I'm tired,

929
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:35,965
but we got meat smoking,
and that's dinner.

930
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,469
Yum!

931
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,738
So I got to go get firewood.

932
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:44,374
I got to boil more water,
cook some more meat,

933
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,009
keep the smoker going.

934
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,377
Getting there.

935
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,512
We're getting there.

936
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,750
I'm only taking all day,
but we're getting there.

937
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,284
Okay.

938
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,953
Almost done.

939
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,808
Okay, here we go.

940
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,412
First bite, warthog.

941
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:26,716
Overcooked that one.

942
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:27,917
That was crunchy.

943
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,320
That's okay.

944
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,492
It smells like warthog.

945
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,701
It's okay.
It's all good.

946
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,134
It's food.

947
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:48,037
Ooh, I have salt.

948
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,907
I can put salt on this, guys.

949
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,407
I forgot I have salt.
I brought salt.

950
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,477
What am I doing?
Okay, I'm going to grab it.

951
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,280
<i>I am so excited
and so happy</i>

952
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,082
<i>that I made
the last minute decision</i>

953
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,484
to bring salt
as one of my 10 items.

954
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,586
Okay.

955
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,188
Hallelujah.

956
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,192
Sprinkle a little salt.

957
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,527
<i>I brought salt because
the heat and the sun</i>

958
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,396
<i>is going to take all
the electrolytes out of you</i>

959
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:14,831
<i>here in South Africa.</i>

960
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,266
Oh, that's good.

961
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,768
Mm, mm, mm.

962
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:21,037
<i>Even though this meat
is delicious,</i>

963
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:23,907
<i>it's the cherry on top
to have a little seasoning,</i>

964
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,309
<i>a little salt in there.</i>

965
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,876
<i>It is phenomenal.</i>

966
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,513
<i>It is a morale booster
like you can't even imagine.</i>

967
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:34,083
It's like the fat off
a prime rib or something.

968
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,320
<i>It's so exciting
that I have food.</i>

969
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,523
<i>This warthog gives me
the energy and the will</i>

970
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,226
<i>to continue to hunt
and harvest animals</i>

971
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,595
<i>and stay out here
for a long time.</i>

972
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,930
I'm just lounging in
South Africa eating a warthog.

973
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,033
No big deal. No big deal.

974
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,836
Doesn't even feel like
I'm away from home.

975
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,107
Like, I know I am,
but I don't know.

976
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,078
It's weird.

977
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,039
The belly's already gurgling.

978
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,442
That can shut up.

979
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,247
I'm gonna get that fish.

980
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,949
You watch.

981
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,317
I'm gonna get a fish,

982
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,352
and then I'm gonna
get more fish.

983
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,322
And then I'm gonna be like, bah.

984
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,925
And I'll get myself a meal.

985
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:51,462
And then I'm gonna also
deck this place out

986
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,197
and it's gonna be pimpin'.

987
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah, let me get up.

988
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,569
I'm gonna need to find bait.

989
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,838
Something stinky, smelly,
something rotten, old,

990
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,373
hopefully to entice
the fish up.

991
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,011
<i>Once I've gotten one fish,</i>

992
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,348
<i>I'll be able to bait
others in.</i>

993
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,250
<i>But it's about getting
that first bit of bait.</i>

994
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,487
I'm just gonna walk
the shorefront now,

995
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:20,957
see if I can find
anything useful,

996
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,559
like maybe some crabs.

997
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,062
I mean, I am sure
that I could probably

998
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:27,865
survive on prickly pear,

999
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:32,635
but that isn't really
why I came here.

1000
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,204
<i>So when we look
at survival situations</i>

1001
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,074
<i>that people have been put in,
more often than not,</i>

1002
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,076
<i>it's not their
technical skills,</i>

1003
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,112
<i>it's their will to survive</i>

1004
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,247
<i>and their mindset
that has kept them going.</i>

1005
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,516
Little rock pool.

1006
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,786
Maybe there's some crabs
in here.

1007
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:51,187
<i>At the moment, I don't have
any other responsibilities</i>

1008
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:53,523
<i>in my life other than
to my partner,</i>

1009
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,757
<i>my dog, and myself.</i>

1010
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,560
<i>So I don't have
that fear of needing</i>

1011
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,228
<i>to support something else.</i>

1012
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,165
<i>So this is an opportunity for
me to completely start fresh.</i>

1013
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,567
<i>And the $500,000 really
would help us</i>

1014
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:07,436
<i>with the idea of buying a plot
of land, which we would like</i>

1015
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,172
<i>to make our own homestead on.</i>

1016
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,842
Nothing.

1017
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,111
I thought there was
something moving,

1018
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,246
but that was just
my stomach again.

1019
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,483
Easy, gut, easy.

1020
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,352
you're not happy.

1021
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:27,291
I don't know if these crabs
come up on land or not.

1022
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,529
I'm assuming under
wet rocks and the such.

1023
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,534
Is it something I ate?

1024
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,636
Is it something
I haven't eaten?

1025
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:56,552
Okay.

1026
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,798
What the [bleep] is going on?

1027
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,480
My gut's really hurting.

1028
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:27,985
All right.

1029
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:30,787
I need to clean up somehow.

1030
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,263
Right.

1031
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:42,598
So much for exploring
the coastline.

1032
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,269
I don't know
if that's from the water

1033
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:51,073
or from the prickly pear

1034
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,311
or just from a few days
of not really eating.

1035
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:02,351
Or maybe I've been eating
the wrong stuff,

1036
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:05,388
drinking the wrong things.

1037
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,824
<i>I don't know if this is
just a one-off episode</i>

1038
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,892
<i>or if this is gonna last
all night.</i>

1039
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,128
Got to get a fire going
before this gets too bad.

1040
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,264
<i>What I do know is that
quite often,</i>

1041
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:18,167
<i>when things are quick onset,
you vomit first.</i>

1042
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,178
<i>And then the diarrhea
comes later.</i>

1043
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,680
<i>But this has gone
the other way around.</i>

1044
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:34,283
I just vomited up
whatever was in me.

1045
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,085
<i>So is this gonna be something</i>

1046
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,221
<i>that lasts two or three days?</i>

1047
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,122
Oh, my belly hurts.

1048
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,124
<i>I don't have a way
of telling at the moment,</i>

1049
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,227
<i>so I need to get through
tonight to reassess.</i>

1050
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:10,587
My head's cold again now.

1051
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,861
My whole body aches.

1052
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,869
And I don't want
to drink water,

1053
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,037
but I should.

1054
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,285
Just a sip.

1055
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,822
Please stay down.

1056
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,624
Ooh.

1057
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,563
Okay.

1058
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,966
Let's try and go back to sleep.

1059
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,651
I could sit here and wait out
a couple more days.

1060
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,155
Is it worth it?

1061
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,229
Okay, okay, okay.

1062
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,087
This is Jit.

1063
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,722
I'm officially tapping out.

1064
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,599
<i>I wasn't scared
of being on my own,</i>

1065
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,269
<i>but I'm scared of my health.</i>

1066
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,603
Here comes the boat.

1067
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,516
Last night I ended up
soiling myself.

1068
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,851
So I thought, okay,
let's just come back to base

1069
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,753
and sort myself out.

1070
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,823
And then, throughout the night,
was just the vomiting,

1071
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,190
the stabbing pains.

1072
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,026
It just doesn't feel
like a situation which

1073
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,427
I can recover from myself.

1074
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:09,466
There's a lot of people who
have supported me to get here.

1075
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,835
Yeah, four days doesn't feel
like I've done them justice.

1076
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,337
At the same time, my brother
said, trust your gut.

1077
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,073
My gut is not being nice.

1078
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,609
And my partner said,
come back in one piece.

1079
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,514
So I'm trying to honor those.

1080
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,922
<i>I used to think that
my main values were honesty</i>

1081
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,591
<i>and courage,
and now I'm definitely</i>

1082
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:39,062
<i>seeing that health has crept
into one of my main values.</i>

1083
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,565
<i>It's sad to leave
because there was still</i>

1084
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,000
<i>so much I hadn't
explored, but I know</i>

1085
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,636
<i>it was the right thing to do.</i>

1086
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,839
<i>I think a lot of people
talk about strategies</i>

1087
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,511
<i>and have in their mind these
romanticized ideas of what</i>

1088
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:55,978
<i>it's like to be out here--</i>

1089
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:58,447
<i>their ideal shelter
built in their head.</i>

1090
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,550
<i>They're going to catch
this on day one.</i>

1091
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,553
<i>They'll build that there.</i>

1092
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,289
<i>And it's fantastic,
and you do need a plan,</i>

1093
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,592
<i>but no plan survives.</i>

1094
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:15,397
Good morning, Africa.

1095
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,866
All alone.

1096
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,801
Not another human
to bear witness.

1097
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,004
<i>It's like
the Wild West out here.</i>

1098
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,474
They put me in
the middle of a [bleep] desert.

1099
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,608
I'm really thirsty
right now, man.

1100
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:26,875
It's super hot.

1101
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,577
Everybody's got
to be dehydrated.

1102
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,279
Big old scorpion.

1103
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,247
Holy [bleep].

1104
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,881
Rocks just came off that cliff.

1105
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,450
Baboons are not happy with me.

1106
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,518
All the animals can see
every move I make.

1107
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,587
I don't think they
like the new intruders.

1108
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,155
Something's moving around.

1109
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,690
I can't tell what it is.

1110
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,292
Oh, my God, it's a snake.

1111
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:45,794
Wildabeest,
coming right to me.

1112
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,465
Look at the size of that.

1113
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:49,965
Yes.

1114
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,234
<i>All the planning,
the tips, and tactics,</i>

1115
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,036
<i>and secrets, and stuff
you work out in your brain--</i>

1116
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:55,371
<i>, none of that matters.</i>

1117
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,640
That's what
I'm talking about.

1118
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:58,641
No!

1119
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,376
Gotcha!

1120
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,877
<i>There is no right way.</i>

1121
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,612
<i>There's no manual,
there's no book to go to.</i>

1122
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,614
Please, God, help me
catch something.

1123
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,449
- Wow!
- Freaking giraffe.

1124
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,352
There's a nice big storm
coming through.

1125
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,555
It appears my tarp
is not very waterproof.

1126
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,790
Holy hell, we have a river.

1127
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,958
Oh, my goodness.

1128
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,793
Yes.

1129
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,664
<i>This whole journey is an
emotional roller coaster.</i>

1130
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:21,797
Gonna puke.

1131
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,500
<i>It's wild.</i>

1132
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:25,869
Give me the
out of this place.

1133
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,202
Oh, God.

1134
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,638
I'm so exhausted,
I can't keep going.

1135
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,206
.

1136
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,191
.

1137
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:52,529
<i>Even the idea of
drinking makes me feel sick.</i>

1138
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,166
<i>I feel like this
is the best site.</i>

1139
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,201
I feel like it's got
everything you need,

1140
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:04,074
and I'm just not in a place
where I can make it happen.

1141
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:09,979
<i>Something in my body is
saying this isn't going well.</i>

1142
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,047
I just can't get myself
down to get water.

1143
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:16,386
So if I can't recover from
it without putting myself

1144
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,521
at a lot of risk,
then I don't think

1145
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,958
there's a positive outcome.

1146
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:29,599
How are you feeling?

1147
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,133
Yeah, a bit rough.

1148
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:33,470
It's one of those things that
could just be a 24-hour bug.

1149
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,205
I vomited a few times
overnight, yeah--

1150
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:36,940
- Yeah.
- and had diarrhea.

1151
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,876
No, just lightheaded, man.

1152
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,877
Lightheaded?

1153
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,178
Yeah.

1154
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,480
Body aches, as well.

1155
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,247
All the joints are achy.

1156
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,317
OK.

1157
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,759
Start feeding
you some nutrients,

1158
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,159
and take it from there, OK?

1159
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:03,032
<i>It's amazing how
much of an impact</i>

1160
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,802
<i>this experience can have
in such a short time.</i>

1161
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:10,240
<i>And it's helped
me question what</i>

1162
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,509
<i>I thought were my core values.</i>

1163
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,210
<i>And that's OK, because I think
it's important to reassess</i>

1164
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,880
<i>your values every so often.</i>

1165
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,248
<i>I can safely say that
I would bump courage</i>

1166
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,083
<i>to the side for health.</i>

1167
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,053
<i>And that's an amazing
reflection and something</i>

1168
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:27,523
<i>I hope to carry on as I get
home, to find other ways</i>

1169
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,159
<i>of prioritizing my health--</i>

1170
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,560
<i>whether it be my
physical health</i>

1171
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,229
<i>or, like I said, my mental
health, or finding ways</i>

1172
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:36,633
<i>to slow down and take time
to enjoy the small things.</i>

1173
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,869
Not stoked.

1174
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,473
Nausea settling a little bit?

1175
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,441
Yeah.

1176
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:57,085
Take a set of vitals
on you, and then just

1177
01:05:57,086 --> 01:06:00,155
go through a little bit
of an assessment here.

1178
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,025
Make sure there's no flags.

1179
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:12,401
Then the stabbing pains
in the lower right subsided?

1180
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:13,802
- It has subsided, yeah.
- OK.

1181
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,438
Did it feel like
it was coinciding

1182
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,206
with gas movement or anything?

1183
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:18,508
Not that you noticed?

1184
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,043
There was no rhythm to
it that I could work out.

1185
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,044
OK.

1186
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,846
It just came.

1187
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,515
Yeah.

1188
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:29,052
Any difficulties
breathing, respirations?

1189
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,720
If I take too
deep a breath, then--

1190
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,288
- You just feel that same--
- Feel like my heart hurts.

1191
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,722
Yeah.
- You feel that same pressure?

1192
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,723
Yes.

1193
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:35,724
OK.

1194
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,093
If I take a deep inhale.

1195
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,795
And then, as best as
you're aware, last night,

1196
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,064
no signs of fever?

1197
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,398
No shivering, trembling?

1198
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:44,800
I mean,
it was a chilly night.

1199
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:45,767
Yeah.

1200
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,803
I-- I was sweating.

1201
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,639
Yeah, OK.

1202
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,841
Yeah, I was
sweating last night.

1203
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,009
Dehydration can
cause many issues.

1204
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,114
Any pain?

1205
01:06:58,248 --> 01:07:00,950
No, none.

1206
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:01,951
Any down here?

1207
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,720
Nothing.

1208
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,322
I think rest, relaxation,
pushing fluids is really

1209
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,992
going to give you that reboot.

1210
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,325
Let's get you taken care of.

1211
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,196
<i>Because it was
only four days,</i>

1212
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:15,797
<i>I don't know if I
got that opportunity</i>

1213
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,767
<i>to really challenge whether
or not I could do this.</i>

1214
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,168
<i>And that might be
something that hangs</i>

1215
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,538
<i>over my head for a while.</i>

1216
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,772
<i>But at the same time,
by leaving now</i>

1217
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,240
<i>I'm gaining health.</i>

1218
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,044
<i>Although it was short, the
time out there, I'm really</i>

1219
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,979
<i>happy that I got to do that.</i>
